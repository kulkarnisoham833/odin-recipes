        <h3>Veggie Black Bean Enchiladas</h3>
        <p>These vegetarian enchiladas are a hearty and satisfying dinner. Make them on a weeknight and youâ€™ll enjoy leftovers for lunch the next day. Or make it on the weekend and invite friends over to make a party out of it! You could make a double batch and freeze the extras.</p>

        <h3>Zippy Shepherd's Pie</h3>
        <p>Gather the family round with this quick and easy shepherd's pie recipe. The meat mixture can be made ahead and frozen. You can also substitute instant potatoes for the real thing if you're in a hurry. I especially love to use white cheddar in this recipe!</p>

        <h3>Baked Ziti</h3>
        <p>This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and everyone loved it. Now it is the favorite of all my dinner guests. I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.</p>
